    "> In this video, I have demonstrated cross validation through an example and then showed you how to implement it in code using the Sklearn library. Cross validation is a powerful technique for evaluating machine learning models by splitting data into training and test sets multiple times. This ensures that each set of data is used as both a training set and a testing set.\n",
